ZenTime Minimalist Time management Application
In today’s world, time management is an essential skill, as people are faced with numerous tasks and responsibilities in their daily lives. Many existing time management applications are often overloaded with features or designed in ways that do not align with the needs of users who prefer simplicity. As a result, these applications can feel burdensome rather than helpful.
The concept of a minimalist time management application was therefore introduced to address this issue. ZenTime is designed to help users manage their time effectively with a clean, simple interface and only essential features, enabling them to focus on what truly matters. The app also operates offline to maintain user privacy and minimize distractions from external systems.
Through the development of this project, it was found that a minimalist approach helps users learn the system quickly and improves overall satisfaction. Applying the 60–30–10 color rule effectively created visual balance and guided user attention to key interface elements. Choosing React Native over Flutter enhanced flexibility in design and functionality. Moreover, designing based on real user behavior through persona analysis allowed the app to solve actual time management challenges. As a result, ZenTime is not only easy to use but also delivers a meaningful experience that empowers users to manage their time more efficiently in real life.
